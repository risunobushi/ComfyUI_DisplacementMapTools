# ComfyUI_DisplacementMapTools

These 2 nodes do something easy that I needed ComfyUI to do and I couldn't find nodes that did.
Might add more stuff in the future, who knows.

- Extract Displacement Map Node
This node accepts a Normal Map and outputs a Displacement Map. The Displacement Map cannot currently be previewed, but it's there, trust me.

- Displace Logo
Using the obtained Displacement Map, we can warp a planar image, like a logo, to adapt to the Displacement Map. Useful for placing logos on non flat stuff.
